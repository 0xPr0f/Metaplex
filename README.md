Metaplex query on chain data and lets you read and write data while in a metaverse, you can buy, sell and trade nfts while still viewing your favourite nft collections.

This Web3verse is a multiplayer style where plarers can join your lobby and explorer your verse with you,
it has voice chat for communicating with other players

There is a button named hub in the verse where you can query nft data and mint Nft for free on the polygon network to your self or a friend
there are more tabs for querying nft data.  
The NFT tab brings out all the nfts owned by the contract address and the name and description of the nfts and was done using the moralis api, this was optimised to withstand hight amount of nft pulls that may cause crashes, hangs, lags, stacked requestsand e.t.c.  
The NFT DATA tab shows the address of the collection, the name of the collection, the symbol of the collection, the nfts in the collection and the time the nft collection was updated, this was done using the covalent api  
The TRASACTION tab shows all the trasaction the collection has made, this is done using the covelent api  
The PORT tab has is where the ability to mint nfts are done, this is done using nft port and the easy minting to gassless mint nfts.

There is a LOGS tab that gives out all the logs about the NFTs active in view in the verse, this was done with covalent api

There is the option to turn on your miic and speak, but this is off by defualt and you can hear what others are saying when your mic is off
